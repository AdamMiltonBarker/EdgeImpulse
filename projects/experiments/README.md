# Introduction

Edge Impulse Experiments are a powerful new feature that allows users to run multiple active impulses within a single project. This enables seamless experimentation with various model configurations on the same dataset, offering a more efficient way to compare results.

The updated interface includes a new "Experiments" section, which centralizes impulse management and integrates the EON Tuner for enhanced trial handling. Along with API enhancements and streamlined processes, these changes significantly accelerate development and improve project organization, making it easier to transition from data collection to deployment.

This project provides a walk through of how to use experiments, along with source codes and a tutorial that will help you get started with Edge Impulse Experiments.
